Arrays
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   It is collection of similar data elements where each element is given a 
common name and can be distinguiished on the basis of incides. 
It stores data in contiguous memory location.

Disadvantage:
------------------------------------
- Fixed size (cann't be changed during runtime)

Java Array vs C Array:
---------------------------------------
- Arrays in java take memory space during runtime, while arrays in C
   , memory is allocated at compiletime.
- java arrays get the dafault value as per the data type, while C arrays 
   get default GARBAGE VALUE.
- initialization -> java: int arr[] = new int[5];	     C: int arr[5];
- declaration -> java: int arr[];	(int arr[5] X)	     C: int arr[5];
- If we are accessing a index value which is greater than the maximum index value
  of array then in java gives : ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime, while
  C array sets the default garbage value to that particular index value.
- java arrays suports attributes like .length, etc...while C arrays don't have such attributes
  support.
- to point to index values while iterating, java don't allow use of 'long' data type(CTE){double}
  instead we can use byte, short, int . while C allows all the three integer data 
  types are allowed (short,int long)
- int a[] = new int[0]; (correct) 		int arr[0]; (CTE)
- Jagged Arrays are allowed in java, while it is not allowed in C.

#PTR: local variable must hve a DEFAULT value in java,  while in C is  gets the garbage value.
#PTR: Java arrays are only initiaized during runtime, while creation is only at runtime.


'new' Keyword
------------------------------------
- allocate memory dynamically in a data structure known as HEAP(only).
- initialization with default initial values
- returns address.


#NOTE: Garbage Collector
- It is a thread which looks for the unassigned value in the whole program and delete that 
part of the program which is not being used in the program aymore.

Jagged Arrays
---------------------------------
multi-dimensional arrays of different sizes or non-rectangular matrix.
